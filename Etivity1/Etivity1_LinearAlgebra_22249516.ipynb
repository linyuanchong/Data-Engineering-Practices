Throughout the first lab and lecture, I watched the materials provided and came up with a conclusion of my own. My understanding of linear algebra is that it is a mathematical representation of vector spaces and matrices, and also a way to store data sets when it comes to serving the purpose of Machine Learning. The paragraphs below will be covering three importance of Linear Algebra in Machine Learning: Data sorting, recommender systems, and deep learning (Brownlee, 2018).\n","\n","Unlike humans, machines are capable of storing and studying an enormous amount of data due to the possession of non-volatile memory. A huge amount of data is fed to machines in order to allow them to iteratively process and study the data, then slowly learn by analogy. However, humans are incapable of perfectly filtering out incompatible data before feeding them to machines due to intelligence restrictions. Machines themselves are expected to have the ability to consider and review the data provided, and this is where one of the biggest uses of Linear Algebra in Machine Learning comes into place. Machines are able to neglect irrelevant data values such as outliers based on how the data is plotted on a graph. Data modeled after each iteration might also come in bad shapes such as overfitting and underfitting. Linear Algebra helps in evaluating data models produced from each iteration. Overfitting describes a data model that fits the existing observations too well but fails to predict future new observations (Liu, 2020). In this case, with the help of Linear Algebra, researchers are able to evaluate data models and make further decisions from there.\n","\n","A good data model is capable of a lot of uses, and providing recommendations based on it is one of them. With an appropriate amount of data and correct data modeling done, a data model will show a pattern and tell how consistent the data values are. Linear Algebra is capable of helping researchers discover specific patterns from these data values. These patterns can later be used to construct various functionalities. One of the most typical examples of this is a recommendation system. Recommendation systems are usually embedded as a passive feature in many applications these days, users’ activity data are collected and processed to be provided with more relevant content that can inflict larger interests (Brownlee, 2018).\n","\n","Linear Algebra also aids in deep learning. In fact, Linear Algebra is capable of describing deep learning methods using matrix notations. In order to execute neural networks, Linear Algebra is needed to structurize data in order for the data to be eligible for processing. In this week’s lab and lecture, we covered the basic concepts of vectors and matrices. These two mediums are two of the most typical materials when it comes to executing deep learning tasks. Aside from these, deep learning methods also work with tensors of input and coefficients (Brownlee, 2018).\n","\n","**References**\n","\n","Brownlee, J., 2018. 10 Examples of Linear Algebra in Machine Learning.
